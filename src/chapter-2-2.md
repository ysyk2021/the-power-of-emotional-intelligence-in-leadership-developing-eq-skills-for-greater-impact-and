Emotional intelligence refers to an individual's ability to recognize, understand, and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Emotional intelligence includes both personal and social competencies, which are essential for effective leadership.

The Four Components of EQ

Emotional intelligence consists of four components, which are:

### Self-Awareness

Self-awareness refers to an individual's ability to recognize and understand their own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and values. Leaders with strong self-awareness are better equipped to identify their own biases and emotions, and regulate them in order to make sound decisions.

### Self-Management

### Social Awareness

Social awareness refers to an individual's ability to recognize and understand the emotions and needs of others. Leaders with strong social awareness skills are better equipped to build rapport with team members, communicate effectively, and foster collaboration.

### Relationship Management

Relationship management refers to an individual's ability to use their emotional intelligence to build and maintain relationships with others. Leaders with strong relationship management skills are better equipped to inspire and motivate team members, resolve conflicts, and provide feedback that promotes growth and development.
